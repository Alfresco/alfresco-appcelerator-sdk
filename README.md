alfresco-appcelerator-sdk
=========================

Private repo for hybrid mobile project work

The Appcelerator modules must be built at the command line with build.py and ant accordingly. The resultant zips must then be copied into Titaniums library folder, and the Titanium project should then pick them up while building.  Please see Appcelerators online documentation for information on building Modules.
